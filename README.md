# üí∞ Syfe Goal-Based Savings Planner

This project is a take-home assignment for a Frontend Intern position. It's a lightweight, client-side only Savings Planner that allows users to create and track multiple financial goals in different currencies (INR and USD).

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack & Design Choices

### Framework: Next.js (with TypeScript)
### Styling: Tailwind CSS

### Data Handling
- **Persistence**: `localStorage` was used for client-side persistence as per the assignment's client-only constraint. It's a simple and effective way to save user data between sessions without a backend.
- **API Communication**: The native `fetch` API is used for making requests to the exchange rate API, with proper handling for loading and error states to enhance user experience.
